# mainframe-misc
While making the journey into the wonderful world of the mainframe, I've started writing some small bits of code, usally consisting of one or 2 files (datasets).  Given the simplicity and size of each, I do not feel like they warrant a seperate github repo.  This repo is my collection of random small bits of useful things for mainframes, [MVS 3.8J/TK4-](http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/) primarily.
